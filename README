The doingitwrongnotebook project contains cookbook programming examples. The examples represent working prototype code and basic helloworld type applications in a variety of different programming languages and with other tools. The code will work but it may not contain the best practice approach. The goal of this project is to show you working code not necessarily mature production ready code.
